I am a retired computer scientist who nonetheless likes to keep up with whats happening in the world of computing. Especially distributed systems since that is what I pursued in grad school. Professionally, I implemented the name service and session level protocol that made a homogeneous object oriented operating system distributed. I also provided logging support to recover file systems and created multithreading support in language runtimes. 

I am fascinated by the work in cloud computing and how it is evolving into a distributed services platform. I have started to dive into this space. I like the separation of concern between the microservices and their communications provided by the service meshes. This is enabling distributed services that support observability, resilience, and security. 

Language wise, I want to get more familiar with GoLang (I like CSP and types with interfaces). Also want to learn more about Rust. I plan to do that by studying projects implemented in those languages. So right now I an in a learning phase and having fun doing it. Will update this file when I start to exit this phase.
